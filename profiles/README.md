# Preset Profiles

## [Default](./default/)

This is the default configuration. Virtually all extra features are disabled in this profile to ensure compatibility with as many configurations as possible.

## [Hephaestus](./hephaestus/)

This profile is for a Voron V2.4 with TAP and a nozzle brush. This is what I use on my personal machine.
