# PrintCFG Klipper Suite

[![GitHub Super-Linter](https://github.com/rootiest/printcfg/workflows/Lint%20Code%20Base/badge.svg)](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/super-linter)

This set of macros is a full suite of features for Klipper.

It is designed to be fully customizable to fit any printer or configuration. All without having to edit or understand the macros themselves. All configuration for the macros is done in the [user_profile.cfg](profiles/default/variables.cfg) file.

## Documentation

### [Documentation is available in the Wiki](https://github.com/rootiest/printcfg/wiki)

## Features

- Start/End Gcode Macros
- Bed Meshing (including adaptive meshing)
- Smart Filament Change Macros
- Fan Control Macros (bed fans, nevermore filter/exhaust fans, etc)
- Door Panel Button Macros

- Custom Heater Control

- Audio Status Notifications
- Custom Parking Behavior
- Nozzle Brushing and Prime Line Macros

All of this can be configured and used with absolutely no knowledge of creating macros. Simply set configuration values like you do for other klipper configurations and the macros will automatically adjust to your settings.
